= Basic files for testing Apache features =

Just a bunch of files that I use to quickly test server features. It shouldn't be useful to other people...

== Important ==

	- Most of the files will throw an error if the specified featured isn't available.
	- Some of the files can give other people informations that could be used to detect security breaches, so always delete the test files and use it with care.
	- Always use a hidden or password protected folder to test.
